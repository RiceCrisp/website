I'm a Frontend Developer living in Chicago. My expertise is WordPress powered websites for B2B companies with a heavy focus on speed and search engine optimization. You can see some of my work here:

- [Walker Sands](https://www.walkersands.com)
- [AmpliFund](https://www.amplifund.com)
- [BillTrust](https://www.billtrust.com)
- [Miller Heiman Group](https://www.millerheimangroup.com)
- [rSquared](https://www.rsquaredcre.com)
- Mattersight (acquired by NICE)
- [Mednax](https://www.mednax.com)
- CloudCraze ROI Calculator (acquired by SalesForce)
- [Porter Keadle Moore](https://www.pkm.com)
- [Modern Dental](https://www.moderndentalchicago.com)

and a couple other sites that were acquired by larger companies such as SalesForce. Keep in mind that I usually hand ownership of the site over to the company after launch, so I don't have control over how the sites may look or behave in their current state.
